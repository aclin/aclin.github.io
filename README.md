## Hello!
I'm Allan, and this is my personal website. It is a basic resume/portfolio website to showcase what I have done as a software engineer.

---
### Build:
This page is built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). I use an npm script to move the production build files to the root level so that I can use the root level GitHub user page, rather than something like aclin.github.io/portfolio.

---
### Goals:
I have a few goals in building this website, each detailed further below:
 - [Get to know me beyond my resume](#goal-beyond)
 - [Give a distraction-free overview of my accomplishments](#goal-simple)
 - [Build a website from scratch](#goal-build)

#### Get to know me beyond my resume
It's hard to get to know someone from just a collection of bullet points on a piece of paper or PDF file. Since I claim to be a front-end and full-stack software engineer, it's important that **_I show you_** that I am capable in this role. Furthermore, I want you to get a closer view, maybe even a demo, or what I have done.

#### Give a distraction-free overview of my accomplishments
If you are looking at this web page and wondering, _"Why does everything look so simple?"_, I will tell you that **this is intentional.**

I do enjoy minimalist designs, but I think it is important that you get a distraction-free experience in getting to know me. I don't want to bore you with some trite image of a mountain or a supposedly "deep" quote.

I want to make sure that everything you see here is to the point. If something catches your eye, it should showcase a skill set.

#### Build a website from scratch
Yes, I realise that the project is built using Create React App, but a build tool is inevitable with the complexity of the modern web app. However, beyond the build deployment, I try to write **all the HTML and CSS myself.** Other than importing stylesheets for fonts and font-icons, I avoid using any pre-made themes such as Material, Foundation or Bootstrap. I use them as a reference, which allows me to learn how different effects are created, and what are good practices for creating complex theme designs.
